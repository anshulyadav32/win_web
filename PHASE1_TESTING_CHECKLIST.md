## 🐛 Error Handling Testing

### ✅ Network Error Testing
- [ ] Disconnect Android from Wi-Fi
- [ ] WebSocket connection should show "Disconnected"

- [ ] All devices show "Connected" status
- [ ] Touch events from all devices logged correctly
- [ ] No performance degradation
- [ ] Server remains responsive

### ✅ Memory Testing
- [ ] Run server for 30+ minutes
- [ ] Connect/disconnect multiple clients
- [ ] Check for memory leaks in Flutter app
