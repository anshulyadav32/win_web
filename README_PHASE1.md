# Remote Mouse - Phase 1 (Foundation: Setup & Connectivity)

## 🎯 Objective
Get the **Flutter Windows server** running, serve a **web client** over Wi-Fi, and establish a **WebSocket connection** that logs client events.

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Flutter Windows Project Setup
- ✅ Flutter project with Windows desktop support enabled
- ✅ Server dependencies added (shelf, shelf_web_socket, path)

### 2. HTTP Server Implementation
- ✅ HTTP server bound to `0.0.0.0:8080`
- ✅ Serves web client files from `/web_client` directory
- ✅ Static file serving with proper MIME types
- ✅ Security measures (directory traversal protection)

### 3. WebSocket Endpoint
- ✅ `/ws` route for WebSocket connections
- ✅ Connection/disconnection logging
- ✅ Message logging with JSON parsing
- ✅ Specific pointer movement event logging

### 4. Server UI Features
- ✅ Local IP address detection and display
- ✅ Port configuration (8080)
- ✅ Connection URL display
- ✅ Real-time connection logs
- ✅ Connected client count
- ✅ Start/Stop server controls

### 5. Android Web Client
- ✅ Full-screen touchpad interface
- ✅ Touch event handling (touchstart, touchmove, touchend)
- ✅ Mouse event support for desktop testing
- ✅ WebSocket connection with auto-reconnect
- ✅ JSON message format: `{"type":"pointer_move","dx":5,"dy":-3}`
- ✅ Visual feedback and connection status
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI design

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option 1: Flutter App (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the Flutter Windows app
flutter run -d windows
```

1. Click the **Play** button in the app to start the server
2. Note the displayed IP address and port
3. Open `http://<your-ip>:8080` on your Android device

### Option 2: Standalone Test Server
```bash
# Run the test server directly
dart run test_server.dart
```

## 📱 Testing on Android

1. **Connect to same Wi-Fi**: Ensure your Android device and Windows PC are on the same network
2. **Open browser**: Navigate to `http://<windows-ip>:8080` in Chrome or any modern browser
3. **Test touchpad**: 
   - Touch and drag on the screen
   - Watch the Windows console for pointer movement logs
   - Connection status should show "Connected"

## 🔍 Expected Behavior

### Server Console Logs
```
Server started on 192.168.1.50:8080
Web client available at: http://192.168.1.50:8080
Client connected (Total: 1)
Received: {"type":"pointer_move","dx":5,"dy":-3,"timestamp":1695123456789}
Pointer move: dx=5, dy=-3
Client disconnected (Total: 0)
```

### Web Client Features
- **Connection Status**: Shows "Connected" when WebSocket is active
- **Touch Feedback**: Visual feedback when touching the screen
- **Auto-reconnect**: Automatically reconnects if connection is lost
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both mobile and desktop browsers

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

- ✅ Server runs on Windows without errors
- ✅ Android device opens URL and loads web client
- ✅ Moving finger on Android touchpad sends JSON events → Windows logs them
- ✅ Connection/disconnection messages visible in Windows console

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check if port 8080 is already in use
- Ensure Windows Firewall allows the connection
- Try running as administrator

### Android can't connect
- Verify both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network
- Check the IP address displayed in the server UI
- Try accessing the URL from a desktop browser first

### WebSocket connection fails
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure the server is running and accessible
- Try refreshing the web client page

## 🚀 Next Steps (Phase 2)
- Implement actual mouse control using Windows APIs
- Add click events (left, right, middle)
- Implement scroll wheel support
- Add keyboard input support
